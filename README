Hello! To anyone who reads this...  my new role in life is to be a GDD graduate in IT. I will meet (in the future) many acquaintances, new connection, new people, and new worlds (aka other countries if ever: D). Assuming I was able to graduate from CSB in BS-IT, I will then become a Game Designer/Programmer in a very well known Gaming Company. Companies such as EA, Crytek, Ubisoft etc…  Well I hope so .
